# Microphone array-based direction of arrival for gunshot detection
Bandpass filters(BPF), allows frequencies in the band of 3KHz to pass through while attenuating others outside the range. ❖The following custom IP will contain the following new additions-


*Developing a detection system for the army that accurately identifies the direction of enemy gunfire using Classification and Localization Algorithm.


*Localization algorithm approaches -Hexagonal Arrangement-of microphones such that each detects sound on different time intervals TDOA(Time Difference of Arrival)is calculated, forming hyperbola which intersects with each other pinpointing gunshot location , 99.99percent accuracy.[d12=vΔT12] [√(x−x1 )2+(y−y1 )2+(z−z1 )2−√(x−x2 )2+(y−y2 )2+(z−z2 )2=vΔT12]
